These advantages have enabled more precise cortical mapping, refined subcortical delineation, and improved quantification of field-dependent biomarkers that are difficult or impossible to resolve at lower field strengths. As a result, 7T MRI has become an increasingly important tool in neuroscience research, early disease characterization, and the development of quantitative imaging methodologies. Despite its scientific value, the widespread use of 7T MRI remains constrained by high installation and maintenance costs, limited availability, and regulatory restrictions in clinical settings. Consequently, many large-scale studies and longitudinal cohorts rely predominantly on data acquired at heterogeneous and often lower field strengths, leading to systematic variability in image contrast, resolution, and quantitative measurements. This field-dependent heterogeneity poses a major challenge for cross-center data integration, retrospective analysis, and the translation of high-field insights into broader research and clinical contexts. Addressing this gap requires methodological advances that can bridge differences across magnetic field strengths while preserving anatomical fidelity and quantitative consistency. In this context, the ability to infer high-field–equivalent image representations from arbitrary input field strengths offers a promising pathway to extend the scientific benefits of ultrahigh-field MRI beyond its physical deployment. By leveraging cross-field information learned from multi-field datasets, such approaches have the potential to enable more uniform structural analysis, enhance the reuse of data from existing cohorts, and support high-resolution investigations in settings where access to 7T systems is limited. This task is designed within this broader scientific motivation, providing a controlled benchmark to study how well current methods can approximate ultrahigh-field characteristics under realistic, heterogeneous acquisition conditions. This task focuses on generating 7T-equivalent brain MRI from an arbitrary input field strength, establishing ultra-high-field imaging as a unified reference domain. The aim is to reconstruct images that match the fidelity, contrast properties, and fine anatomical detail characteristic of true 7T acquisitions. Participants may design separate models for different input field strengths to address field-dependent variations in noise, resolution, and contrast behavior. The availability of prospectively acquired paired scans with real 7T references enables direct and quantitative assessment of structural consistency and contrast accuracy across field transformations. By defining a fixed high-field output domain, this task offers a rigorous benchmark for advancing generative methods that support multi-field harmonization and broaden access to ultra-high-field image quality.",-1)])])}const u=a(r,[["render",o]]);export{g as __pageData,u as default};
